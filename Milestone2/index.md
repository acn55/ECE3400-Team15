# Introduction  
The purpose of milestone 2 was to implement a wall following algorithm, expand our line following algorithm, as well as integrate everything from labs 1 and 2.  
  
## Expanding on Line Follow  
Our previous implementation of line follow didn’t really change, but we had to properly implement a function for turning left and right in place. This resulted in the functions:  
* turn_left_linetracker()  
* turn_right_linetracker()  
The functionality can be seen in the specification as well as the code below.
